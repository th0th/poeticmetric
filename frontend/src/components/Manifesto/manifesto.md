### Building a better web:

# PoeticMetric's Vision

For years, businesses have relied on products like Google Analytics, but every "free" offer often comes at an invisible cost: **your users' privacy and your own peace of mind**. That story is finally shifting, thanks to new rules, growing awareness, and, most importantly, solutions that put people back in control.

I started PoeticMetric out of frustration with endless headlines about data misuse and shady marketing. But venting about the state of the industry only gets you so far. **If we want to change things for good, we need to offer businesses tools that don't just protect privacy, but actually help them grow and make smarter decisions.**

That is what PoeticMetric is for. You get all the benefits of powerful analytics. Clarity, insight, and the confidence to make real improvements without having to trade away your values, your users' trust, or your company's compliance with privacy laws.

As PoeticMetric has grown, I have noticed that a few simple ideas come up again and again. Whether I am planning features, hearing from users, or just thinking about what I wish analytics tools could do, these principles have a way of guiding every decision. They are not just empty words or nice marketing lines. They are the backbone of how we work and what we build.

## 0. Freedom and privacy for everyone

PoeticMetric is **free as in freedom**, and also **free as in beer** with the pro bono **Hobbyist** plan. The code is open and yours to explore, and your data stays yours. You never have to worry about it being sold, shared, or turned into someone else's ad revenue. We are here so you can make real, data-informed decisions for your business, knowing you are staying on the right side of the law and the people who use your site.

## 1. Transparency you can check for yourself

It shouldn't be up to trust alone. Our [full source code is public](https://code.unius.sh/unius/poeticmetric), and we are clear about how data flows and what actually gets tracked. You can dive in, ask questions, export your site's analytics, or delete it all any time you choose.

## 2. Insight, not overwhelm

PoeticMetric is built to give you what actually matters: useful answers, not endless spreadsheets or vague numbers. Whether you are running a side project, a fast-growing business, or a larger operation, you get the information you need, right when you need it. We have kept the setup simple, the performance fast, and the reports easy to understand so you can focus on running your site, not deciphering your analytics.

## 3. Sustainability, plain and simple

We are a bootstrapped, for-profit company, and that means no chasing after big investors or taking on features we don't believe in. Our goal is to stay self-sufficient so we can keep building features our actual users want, not just what looks good in a pitch deck. With our Free plan, you can get started and see if PoeticMetric fits your needs before you ever spend a dime.

If something isn't working for you, or there is a feature we are missing that would make your life easier, please let us know. We are building this for you, and we are always listening.

Cheers,  
Gokhan
