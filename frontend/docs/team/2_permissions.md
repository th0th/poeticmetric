## Permissions

The first team member, who signed up is set as the **organization owner**. Organization owner is indicated with a small lightning icon on their avatar in the team members list.

<img alt="owner" src="/docs-files/team/permissions/owner.png" style="max-width: 400px" />

The organization owner is the only team member who can

* invite new team members,
* access to the subscription and billing details,
* change the organization details in the settings page.

Other than these, there are no difference in terms of permissions between an owner and non-owner team member.
