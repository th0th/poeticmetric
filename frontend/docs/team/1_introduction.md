**PoeticMetric** offers multiple team member accounts for the same organization account to ease collaboration with your colleagues.

## Inviting new members

You can invite your team by going to the [Team](/team) page, and clicking the **Invite new team member** button on top right. When you complete the form, an e-mail with a link will be sent to your teammate.

Until they accept the invite clicking the link included in the e-mail, their account will be listed on the team page with an **"invited by not activated yet"** indicator.
