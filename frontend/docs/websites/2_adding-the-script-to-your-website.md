title: Adding the script to your website
---

To start tracking your website's traffic, you need to update the HTML code of your website and add the PoeticMetric tracking script code to the header section. Put the script between the `<head>` and `</head>` tags.

<div class="alert alert-primary align-items-center d-flex flex-row">
    <span class="bi bi-lightbulb flex-shrink-0 me-3" />

    If you are not the person managing the website's code, and there is someone else who deals with it, you can share the link to this page.
</div>

## PoeticMetric tracking script

The PoeticMetric tracking script code is this:

```html
<script async src="https://www.poeticmetric.com/pm.js"></script>
```

Copy this code, and add it to the `<head>...</head>` section of the every page you want to track.
