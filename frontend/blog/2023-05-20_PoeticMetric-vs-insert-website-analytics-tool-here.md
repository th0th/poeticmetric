title: PoeticMetric vs <insert website analytics tool here>
---

I believe I am somewhat a good software engineer, but I suck really hard at marketing. I dare to develop a website analytics platform singlehandedly from scratch (spoiler alert, it took about 2 years). I don’t have much of a problem with designing the whole architecture, coming up with database schemes, preparing UI designs, **AND EVEN LEARNING A BRAND NEW LANGUAGE IN THE PROCESS** (I switched to golang, after working with python for around 10 years). However, I am more OK with learning another language than spending any time on marketing. And I am a solo indie hacker for 8 years, with two SaaS businesses. Shame…

I tried everything to avoid marketing: I [optimized docker layer caching][1], [added E2E tests][2] and even [made PoeticMetric’s docker images available on multiple platforms, you know, just in case][3]. But at some point, I ran out of procrastinative engineering tasks, and came to realization of the unavoidable harsh truth: **I need to work on marketing**

I have been trying to understand the basics for the last few weeks.

## The actual comparison

Until I prepare a more organized, more SEO-friendly page for comparing PoeticMetric with other services, this blog post will serve for that purpose. So I better do some actual comparison. I am going to split this comparison into two: One for “good ones”, and another one for “bad and ugly ones”.

### PoeticMetric vs Google Analytics, Cloudflare Web Analytics, etc.

Proprietary ones

### PoeticMetric vs Plausible, Matomo, etc.

Open source ones
