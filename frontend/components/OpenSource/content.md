## What is free and open source software?

Free and open source software (FOSS) refers to computer software that is released under a license that allows users to use, modify, and distribute the software freely.

“Free” in this context refers to the freedom to use the software for any purpose, to study how it works, to modify it, and to share it with others. This means that users have access to the source code, which is the underlying code that makes the software work, and can modify and distribute it as they see fit.

“Open source” refers to the practice of making the source code of software freely available to the public. This allows users to see how the software works and to contribute to its development.

## Why is PoeticMetric open source?

There are several reasons why PoeticMetric is open source:

### Transparency and trust

For about 20 years, web analytics has been an area where the tools businesses use are actually the agents for big corporations to collect and analyze the people's behavioral data, and auction it to the highest bidder in the name of "advertisement". We have been using these services simply to see what our customers find useful on the website, and maybe the data alone from a single website would cause no harm. But in the big picture, the personal data collected from many websites combined are used for foreseeing that person's future behavior. And this prediction is sold to the corporation who is willing to pay the topmost price.

Free and open source software is the best way to prevent this misconduct. [PoeticMetric is fully free and open source web analytics.](https://github.com/th0th/poeticmetric) So, anyone can go and check its source code to see what data is collected, and more importantly, how it's handled.

### Collaboration and community

Free and open source software (FOSS) allows the development and improvement to be carried in a collaborative and decentralized manner. If someone finds a bug, notices an issue, or just comes up with a way to improve PoeticMetric, they can easily make the changes they need to on the codebase.**And PoeticMetric welcomes contributions:** So if the change is not specific to their use case, these change will be applied to the original repository and everybody using PoeticMetric will benefit!

In addition to the collaboration aspect, free and open source software enables forming a strong community, too. Since everybody is able to access the source code and understand what is going on, people can ask others for help when the face an issue.

### Innovation
