Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, PoeticMetric specifically disclaims all express or implied warranties of design, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, quality, and non-infringement, that the services will meet customer’s requirements, or that the services will always be available, accessible, uninterrupted, timely, secure, accurate, complete, or error-free. In addition, PoeticMetric does not warrant any connection to or transmission from the internet. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from PoeticMetric or elsewhere nor any course of dealing will create any warranty or condition not expressly stated in this agreement. Except as expressly provided herein, the services are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. These limitations shall apply notwithstanding the failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy provided herein.

## 6. Limitation of liability

Except as expressly provided herein, in no event shall either party's aggregate liability to the other for all claims of any kind, including any claims arising out of or related to this agreement, whether by statute, contract, tort, or under any other theory of liability, exceed the fees paid by the customer for the services subject to the claim during the three (3) months period prior to the first event or occurrence giving rise to such liability.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall either party, its directors, employees, agents, or licensors be liable for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including damages for loss of profits, goodwill use, or data or other intangible losses, that result from the use of, or inability to use, the services or any other aspect of this agreement.

Any claims or damages that one party may have against the other party shall only be enforceable against the parties to this agreement and not any other entity or its officers, directors, representatives or agents.

The parties acknowledge and agree that the essential purpose of this section is to allocate the risks under these terms between the parties and limit their potential liability given the fees charged under this agreement, which would have been substantially higher if PoeticMetric were to assume any further liability other than as set forth herein.
