**PoeticMetric** is a privacy-focused, open source, and blazingly fast alternative to Google Analytics. It doesn't use cookies or any other similar technology, and it doesn't collect any personal data.

## Using PoeticMetric

The quickest way to start using PoeticMetric is, [signing up on the managed service that I offer on www.poeticmetric.com](https://www.poeticmetric.com?utm_source=github&utm_term=using). It is fully operated by me, you can simply create your account and start tracking your website's performance right away!

### Self-hosted

PoeticMetric is a 100% open source website analytics tool. This means, you can run your own instance of PoeticMetric on your own servers. In order to simplify self-hosting process, I also built required docker images, and prepared a sample configuration.

You can read the guide on how to self-host your PoeticMetric instance on [PoeticMetric docs](https://www.poeticmetric.com/docs/open-source/self-hosting).
